# HiBO (High-performance Buffer and Overlay)
Interactive and Online Buffer and Overlay Analytics of Large Spatial Data. An online demo is provided on the Web. The datasets and hardware environment of the DEMO are shown as follows. Experiments on an SMP server with 32 cores/64 threads verify that our approach is capable of handling datasets with ten-million-scale records.

## [Online Demo](http://www.higis.org.cn:8080/hibo/) 

Chrome is Recommended for the Demo.

## Scenario

We have designed a housing site selection scenario to show the effect of the demonstration. Suppose that a new immigrant in Spain wants to choose a place to live which meets the following conditions: 1) convenient to traffic (within 500m from Highways); 2) convenient for children education (within 200m from Education amenities); 3) convenient to the medical care (within 2000m from Healthcare amenities); 4) near to leisure places (within 1000m from Entertainment, Arts & Culture amenities or Waterways but not in Water Area); 5) quiet (at least 300m away from Railways). The conditions can be translated into the following expression. Enter the expression in HiBO and click the Create-Overlay-Layer button (Fig 1), then the result layer will be added to the map in real time. Fig 2 shows the analysis results, in which the red areas are the recommended housing places for the immigrant.
